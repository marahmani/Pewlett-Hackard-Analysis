# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

1.	Overview of the analysis: 

Pewlett Hackard has fallen a bit behind in the database department, we will help them to add their data into a database and do some analysis based on the management requirement. We created tables based on the entity relationship diagram (ERD), and successfully imported the data to each table. We will need to dive into the data and perform queries to learn when employees were hired as well as their age and to search for those who are retiring and when they are retiring. We also need to break down some large list into smaller pieces. We need to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

2.	Results: 

After looking deep into the analysis, we found out that a lot of employees are retired based on the age and the date they got hired.

•	We first created a table that joined two tables employee and title to have all the titles of employees.
